        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are the <strong>Tomatoes and Orchard Producers Association of Nigeria (TOPAN)</strong>, dedicated to advancing the interests of farmers and promoting sustainable agricultural practices across Nigeria.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Youth, Tomatoes and Agriculture in Nigeria</h2>
            <p>Half of the world’s population consists of young people, with 90% living in developing countries. Young people are innovative, interconnected, and adaptable. When empowered with entrepreneurial skills and confidence, they can significantly boost their countries’ economies.</p>
            <p>In Nigeria, youth unemployment stands at 23% (approximately 39 million people) and continues to grow. Many women and young people avoid the agricultural sector due to perceived risks, costs, inefficiencies, and its labor-intensive nature.</p>
            <p>To address these concerns and ensure food security, Nigeria must engage and empower youth by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Addressing their aspirations and expectations for social mobility.</li>
                <li>Replacing the ageing farming population (currently averaging 45-55 years old).</li>
                <li>Increasing productivity to reduce dependence on food imports.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>To provide cutting-edge farming techniques and services that enhance health and horticulture farming in Nigeria.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>TOPAN’s mission is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduce hunger and malnutrition.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Combat climate change</strong> by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote sustainable livelihoods.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Enhance food security</strong> through advocacy, research, training, capacity development, and partnerships with farmers and stakeholders.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>TOPAN's primary goal is to increase food security by ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient tomatoes and orchard products. This supports the Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger while promoting environmental sustainability.</p>
